# Changelog

All notable changes to safe-agent are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-17

Initial release of safe-agent: a sandboxed autonomous AI agent with tool
execution, knowledge graph, multi-interface control, and a full web dashboard.

### Core Agent

- **Multi-backend LLM engine** — supports Claude Code CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI,
  Google Gemini CLI, Aider (multi-provider), OpenRouter API (hundreds of
  models via one key), and local GGUF inference via `llama-gguf`.
- **Structured tool calling** — LLM proposes tool calls via fenced
  `tool_call` blocks; the agent parses, routes through auto-approve or the
  human approval queue, executes, feeds results back, and loops up to
  `max_tool_turns` (default 5).
- **Approval queue** — dangerous tool calls require human approval via the
  dashboard, Telegram, or WhatsApp before execution. Configurable
  `auto_approve_tools` list for safe operations.
- **Tick-based agent loop** — configurable interval (default 120 s) for
  background housekeeping: expiring stale actions, running cron jobs,
  processing background goals, and reconciling skills.

### Autonomy & Planning

- **Goal system** — persistent goals with prioritized task decomposition,
  dependency chains, and automatic execution during the tick loop.
- **Cron scheduler** — enabled cron jobs are evaluated every tick and
  executed via the tool registry. The `cron` tool lets the LLM create,
  list, enable, disable, and remove scheduled jobs.
- **Self-reflection** — after a goal completes or fails, the LLM generates
  a concise self-reflection stored on the goal record.
- **Proactive notifications** — background goal progress and cron results
  are pushed to all configured messaging platforms.

### Memory

- **Core memory** — single-row personality that persists across restarts.
- **Conversation memory** — rolling window of recent messages with
  configurable depth.
- **Archival memory** — long-term storage with SQLite FTS5 full-text search.
- **Knowledge graph** — typed nodes and weighted edges with FTS5 search,
  neighbor traversal, and graph statistics.

### Skill System

- **Skill lifecycle management** — auto-discovery from the skills directory,
  process spawning with resource limits, graceful shutdown (SIGTERM then
  SIGKILL), and automatic restart for daemon skills.
- **Skill manifest** (`skill.toml`) — declares name, description, type
  (daemon/oneshot), entrypoint, environment variables, and credential specs.
- **Credential management** — skills declare required credentials; values
  are stored encrypted on disk and injected as environment variables.
- **Rhai extension system** — skills can register HTTP routes and serve
  custom UI panels/pages via `routes.rhai` and a `ui/` directory.
- **Skill import** — import existing skills from Git repositories, archive
  URLs (`.tar.gz`/`.zip`), or local directories via the dashboard or API.
- **Skill deletion** — remove skills with automatic process cleanup and
  credential purging.

### Dashboard (Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS)

- **Overview tab** — live SSE feed of tool activity with animated
  indicators, pending actions queue, activity log, memory panels, and
  agent stats.
- **Chat tab** — real-time conversation with the agent including
  thinking/executing state indicators.
- **Goals tab** — list goals with status filters, task progress bars,
  expandable detail with self-reflection, and pause/resume/cancel controls.
- **Skills tab** — manage skills with per-skill credential configuration,
  environment variables, log viewer, manifest editor, extension panel, and
  import/delete UI.
- **Knowledge tab** — browse and search the knowledge graph.
- **Tools tab** — view registered tools and their descriptions.
- **Trash tab** — recoverable file deletion with restore and permanent
  delete.
- **Settings tab** — messaging platform configuration.

### Authentication & SSO

- **JWT-based session auth** — password login with HS256 JWT cookies.
- **Multi-provider SSO** — configurable dashboard login via Google, GitHub,
  Microsoft, Discord, Slack, LinkedIn, Spotify, Dropbox, Twitter, Notion,
  Zoom, and Twitch. Allowlist by email address.
- **Multi-account OAuth** — connect multiple accounts per provider for
  calendar, email, and other integrations.

### Messaging Platforms

- **Telegram bot** — full bidirectional messaging with chat ID allowlist,
  typing indicators during tool execution, and proactive notifications.
- **WhatsApp bot** — Baileys-based Node.js bridge with QR code pairing,
  webhook integration, and the same feature set as Telegram.
- **Abstracted messaging layer** — `MessagingManager` with `send_all`,
  `typing_all`, and per-platform routing.

### Multi-User Support

- **User management** — `users` table with UUID IDs, unique usernames,
  display names, emails, and password-based authentication. Three roles:
  `admin` (full access, user management, approval), `user` (chat and tool
  use), `viewer` (read-only dashboard access).
- **Platform identity mapping** — each user can be linked to a Telegram
  user ID and/or WhatsApp number. Incoming messages automatically resolve
  to the correct user for per-user permission enforcement.
- **Per-user conversation memory** — `user_id` column on
  `conversation_history` provides isolated conversation windows per user.
  Also added to `activity_log`, `audit_log`, `goals`, `pending_actions`.
- **UserContext threading** — `handle_message_as()` accepts an optional
  `UserContext` that flows through tool execution, audit logging, and
  memory operations. Viewers are blocked from sending messages.
- **Multi-user dashboard auth** — JWT claims extended with `user_id` and
  `role`. Login supports both legacy single-password and per-user
  username+password modes. SSO callback links emails to existing users.
  Header shows current user identity and role.
- **User management dashboard** — Settings tab includes a full user
  management panel: create users, assign roles, enable/disable accounts,
  link Telegram/WhatsApp IDs, change passwords, and delete users.
- **Backward-compatible** — existing single-user deployments continue to
  work without configuration changes. Multi-user features activate when
  users are created.

### Two-Factor Authentication & Passkeys

- **TOTP 2FA** — users can enable time-based one-time password
  authentication via any standard authenticator app (Google Authenticator,
  Authy, etc.). Setup flow generates a base32 secret with QR code and
  10 single-use recovery codes. TOTP verification uses HMAC-SHA1 (RFC 6238)
  with ±1 time-step tolerance for clock drift.
- **Passkeys (WebAuthn)** — full FIDO2/WebAuthn passkey support via
  `webauthn-rs`. Users can register platform authenticators (Touch ID,
  Windows Hello, Android biometrics) or roaming security keys (YubiKey).
  Registration and authentication use the standard `navigator.credentials`
  browser API with server-side challenge/response verification.
- **Challenge-token login flow** — when 2FA is enabled, password
  authentication returns a short-lived challenge token (5-minute JWT)
  instead of a session. The user must then verify via TOTP code, recovery
  code, or passkey assertion to receive the full session JWT.
- **2FA management API** — `POST /api/auth/2fa/setup`, `/enable`,
  `/disable`, `GET /api/auth/2fa/status`; passkey endpoints at
  `/api/auth/passkey/register/{start,finish}`,
  `/api/auth/passkey/authenticate/{start,finish}`,
  `GET /api/auth/passkeys`, `DELETE /api/auth/passkeys/{id}`.
- **Dashboard 2FA settings panel** — Settings tab includes a dedicated
  Two-Factor Authentication section for managing TOTP setup (with QR code
  scanner), recovery codes, and passkey registration/deletion.
- **Login overlay 2FA flow** — login screen seamlessly transitions to a
  2FA challenge step showing passkey button, TOTP code input, and recovery
  code fallback based on the user's enabled methods.
- **DB schema** — `totp_secret`, `totp_enabled`, `recovery_codes` columns
  on `users` table; new `passkeys` table for WebAuthn credential storage.

### Timezone & Locale Awareness

- **System-level timezone/locale** — configurable via `config.toml` with
  `timezone` (IANA name, e.g. "America/New_York") and `locale` (BCP 47 tag,
  e.g. "en-US") fields. Defaults to UTC / en-US.
- **Per-user overrides** — each user has `timezone` and `locale` columns in the
  `users` table that take precedence over system defaults. Settable via the
  dashboard Settings tab or the `POST /api/timezone` endpoint.
- **Time-aware LLM** — the system prompt now includes the current date/time in
  the user's timezone so the agent can give contextually appropriate responses
  (proper greetings, scheduling, relative time references).
- **Dashboard timezone picker** — Settings tab includes a Timezone & Locale
  panel with browser auto-detection buttons, a searchable IANA timezone input
  with common timezones pre-listed, and a locale text field.
- **Consistent timestamp formatting** — all user-facing timestamps in the
  dashboard (Activity Log, Audit Trail, Chat, Goals, Knowledge Graph, Memory
  panels, OAuth status) are formatted in the browser's local timezone using a
  shared `time.ts` utility that correctly parses both RFC 3339 and SQLite
  `datetime('now')` formats.
- **Timezone API endpoints** — `GET /api/timezone` (current effective
  timezone/locale with formatted time), `POST /api/timezone` (set per-user),
  `GET /api/timezones` (full IANA timezone list), `GET /api/timezone/convert`
  (server-side UTC-to-local conversion with relative day labels).

### Onboarding Wizard

- **First-run setup flow** — a full-screen 4-step wizard appears in the
  dashboard on first launch, guiding the user through initial configuration
  before the normal dashboard UI is shown.
- **Step 1: Agent Identity** — set the agent's display name and core
  personality instructions.
- **Step 2: LLM Backend** — choose from available backends with a "Test
  Connection" button that sends a live test prompt to validate the setup.
- **Step 3: Messaging (optional)** — displays Telegram and WhatsApp status
  with guidance on environment variables; skippable.
- **Step 4: Review & Finish** — summary of all configured settings with a
  "Complete Setup" button.
- **Metadata table** — new `metadata` key-value table in the database stores
  `onboarding_completed` flag; subsequent launches skip the wizard.
- **Config persistence** — agent name, personality, and LLM backend choices
  are written to the TOML config file on disk during onboarding.
- **Auth-exempt endpoints** — all `/api/onboarding/*` routes are placed below
  the auth middleware layer so the wizard works before any user account exists.

### PII Encryption at Rest

- **Auto-generated encryption key** — on first launch the system generates
  a cryptographically random 256-bit AES key and persists it to
  `<data_dir>/encryption.key` with owner-only (0600) permissions. The key
  can also be supplied via the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable for
  containerized deployments.
- **AES-256-GCM field encryption** — all PII fields in the `users` table
  (`display_name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `telegram_id`, `whatsapp_id`,
  `totp_secret`, `recovery_codes`) are encrypted before storage using
  AES-256-GCM with a unique random 12-byte nonce per value. Encrypted
  values carry an `ENC$` prefix for format identification.
- **HMAC-SHA-256 blind indexes** — lookup fields (`email`, `telegram_id`,
  `whatsapp_id`) have companion `*_blind` columns containing deterministic
  HMAC-SHA-256 hashes computed with a derived key. This allows SQL
  equality lookups without ever storing or querying plaintext values.
- **Automatic migration** — on startup, `migrate_encrypt_pii()` scans all
  existing users and transparently encrypts any plaintext PII fields,
  populating blind indexes. Safe to run repeatedly; already-encrypted
  fields are skipped.
- **Graceful legacy support** — the decrypt function treats values without
  the `ENC$` prefix as plaintext, ensuring backward compatibility during
  migration from older database formats.

### Security & Sandboxing

- **Path jailing** — `SandboxedFs` enforces all file operations stay within
  the agent's data directory; symlink and traversal attacks are blocked.
- **Process resource limits** — skills and exec'd commands run with
  `rlimit` caps on CPU time, memory, file size, open files, and process
  count.
- **Landlock LSM** — on Linux, the agent restricts its own filesystem
  access to the data directory and necessary system paths.
- **Chroot jail** — Docker entrypoint builds a minimal chroot with only
  required binaries and libraries.
- **Non-root execution** — Docker image runs the agent as a dedicated
  `safeagent` user (configurable UID/GID).
- **URL validation** — blocks requests to private IPs, localhost, and
  metadata endpoints.
- **SQL injection guard** — input sanitization for all user-provided values
  in queries.
- **Recoverable trash** — `delete_file` moves to a trash directory instead
  of permanent deletion; restorable via the dashboard.
- **Capability-based permissions** — fine-grained per-tool operation
  restrictions via `[security.tool_capabilities]` config. Blocks specific
  commands (e.g. allow `ls` but not `rm` for exec) and tool operations.
- **Structured audit trail** — every tool call, approval decision,
  rate-limit hit, PII detection, and 2FA challenge is logged to the
  `audit_log` table with timestamps, reasoning, params, and source.
  Queryable via API with filtering by event type and tool name.
- **LLM cost tracking** — token usage and estimated USD cost per request
  stored in `llm_usage` table. Model-aware pricing for Claude, GPT, Gemini,
  Llama, DeepSeek, etc. Daily cost limit with automatic alerting.
- **Rate limiting** — sliding-window limiter caps tool calls per minute
  (default 30) and per hour (default 300) to prevent runaway loops.
- **PII/sensitive data detection** — scans LLM responses for SSNs, credit
  cards, API keys, private keys, JWT tokens, AWS access keys, and passwords.
  Flags responses with a warning before delivery.
- **Explainability** — "Why did you do that?" drill-down retrieves the
  causal chain of audit events for any action, showing reasoning at each step.
- **2FA for dangerous operations** — configurable tools (default: `exec`)
  require dashboard confirmation before execution. Time-limited challenges
  with 5-minute TTL.
- **Security dashboard tab** — overview with live stats, filterable audit
  trail, cost tracking with budget progress bars, rate-limit gauges, and
  2FA challenge management.

### Deployment & Operations

- **Multi-architecture Docker image** — builds for `linux/amd64` and
  `linux/arm64` on Alpine Linux with pre-installed Python, Node.js, Claude
  Code CLI, and ngrok. Supports Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon, and Graviton.
- **ACME/Let's Encrypt TLS** — automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning
  with TLS-ALPN-01 challenge.
- **Ngrok tunnel** — optional tunnel for public access and OAuth callbacks.
- **Platform install scripts** — chroot jail scripts for Debian/RPM/Arch
  Linux, macOS sandbox (App Sandbox + TCC), and Windows (PowerShell with
  AppContainer).
- **Health check endpoint** — `/healthz` returns 200 OK (or 503) with
  database, agent, and tool health. Unauthenticated for use with load
  balancers, Docker HEALTHCHECK, and Kubernetes liveness probes.
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` exposes OpenMetrics text format:
  agent info, paused state, tick/approve/reject counters, audit events,
  LLM cost and token gauges, rate limiter state. Unauthenticated for
  Prometheus/Grafana scraping.
- **Auto-update mechanism** — `/api/update/check` queries GitHub Releases
  API for newer versions; `/api/update/apply` runs `git pull` + `cargo
  build --release` (or signals Docker container restart). Dashboard shows
  current vs. latest version, release notes, and one-click update.
- **Backup & restore** — `/api/backup` exports all agent data (memory,
  activity, goals, cron, stats) as a timestamped JSON file. `/api/restore`
  merges the backup via INSERT OR REPLACE. Dashboard has download/upload
  buttons.
- **Multi-node federation** — `FederationManager` with peer registry,
  heartbeat protocol (configurable interval), asynchronous memory delta
  replication, and distributed task claiming. `[federation]` config
  section with `enabled`, `peers`, `advertise_address`, intervals.
  Federation API endpoints for sync, heartbeat, and task claims.
  Dashboard Operations tab manages peers.
- **LLM backend plugin architecture** — `LlmBackend` async trait with
  `LlmPluginRegistry` for dynamic registration. All built-in backends
  auto-register. `register_plugin()` and `switch_backend()` at runtime.
  `/api/llm/backends` lists available and active backends.
- **Operations dashboard tab** — health check viewer, Prometheus info,
  update checker, backup/restore UI, federation peer management, and
  LLM backend plugin overview.

### CI/CD

- **Test workflow** — Rust (`cargo fmt`, `clippy`, `cargo test --release`)
  and Svelte (`pnpm test`, `pnpm build`) on every push/PR to `main`.
- **CodeQL workflow** — static security analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Docker workflow** — multi-arch image build and push to
  `ghcr.io/pegasusheavy/safe-agent` on push to `main` and version tags.

### Configuration

- **TOML config file** — all settings have sensible defaults; environment
  variables can override most values.
- **Example config** — `config.example.toml` documents every option with
  inline comments, including `[federation]` for multi-node setup.
