# Contributing to SafeClaw

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SafeClaw. This document covers everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (2024 edition, stable toolchain)
- **Node.js** (managed via `nvm`) and **pnpm**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for deployment testing)
- A Claude Code CLI installation (for end-to-end testing with the LLM)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pegasusheavy/SafeClaw.git
cd SafeClaw

# Switch to the develop branch (all work starts here)
git checkout develop

# Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the Svelte dashboard
pnpm run build:ui

# Build the Rust binary
cargo build

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DASHBOARD_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, etc.
```

## Git Workflow

This project uses **git-flow** branching. See `AGENTS.md` for the full specification.

### Quick Reference

| Branch | Purpose | Merges into |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production releases only | -- |
| `develop` | Integration branch | `main` (via release) |
| `feature/<name>` | New features and enhancements | `develop` |
| `release/<version>` | Release preparation | `main` + `develop` |
| `hotfix/<name>` | Critical production fixes | `main` + `develop` |

**Never commit directly to `main`.** All work goes through `develop`.

### Starting Work

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

### Submitting Work

Push your feature branch and open a pull request targeting `develop`:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

Then open a PR on GitHub from `feature/my-feature` into `develop`.

## Commit Messages

Write commit messages as if Linus Torvalds is reviewing them. Every commit should be a self-contained, reviewable unit of work.

### Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>
```

- **Subject line**: imperative mood, under 72 characters, no trailing period.
- **Body** (when needed): blank line after subject. Explain *why*, not *how*. Wrap at 72 characters.

### Type Tags

| Tag | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New features or capabilities |
| `fix` | Bug fixes |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `build` | Build system, dependencies, Docker |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks, CI, tooling |

### Examples

Good:

```
feat: add web chat interface to dashboard

The agent was only reachable via Telegram. Add POST /api/chat
endpoint that calls the same handle_message() path and a ChatTab
Svelte component so the operator can message the agent directly
from the dashboard.
```

```
fix: terminate orphaned skill processes on directory deletion

Skill reconciliation was only checking for new skill.toml files,
not for removed directories. Kill the entire process group
(SIGTERM then SIGKILL) when a tracked skill's directory disappears.
```

Bad:

```
update stuff
```

```
WIP
```

```
fix
```

### Rules

- Never use `--no-verify` to skip hooks. Fix the underlying issue instead.
- Do not squash unrelated changes into a single commit.
- Each commit should compile and pass linting on its own.

## Code Style

### Rust

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings. Use `#[allow(...)]` only with an explanation.
- Use `thiserror` for error types, `tracing` for logging (never `println!` or `eprintln!`).
- Prefer `Result<T>` over panics.
- Document public APIs with doc comments.
- All file I/O must go through `SandboxedFs` -- no raw `std::fs` outside the sandbox.
- Secrets come from environment variables, never config files.

### Frontend (Svelte / TypeScript)

- The dashboard is a Svelte 5 app in `src/dashboard/frontend/`.
- Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$effect`, `$derived`) -- not legacy stores.
- Use `untrack()` when writing to reactive state inside an `$effect` to avoid infinite loops.
- Style with Tailwind CSS 4 utility classes. Custom CSS goes in `app.css`.
- Type all API responses with interfaces in `lib/types.ts`.
- Use the `api()` helper from `lib/api.ts` for all HTTP requests (handles 401 redirect).

### Build

After changing frontend code:

```bash
pnpm run build:ui   # Compiles Svelte -> src/dashboard/ui/
cargo build         # Embeds compiled UI into the Rust binary
```

Both steps are required -- the Rust binary embeds the UI files at compile time via `include_str!`.

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create `src/tools/<name>.rs` implementing the `Tool` trait.
2. Register it in `build_tool_registry()` in `src/main.rs`.
3. Tool calls flow through the approval queue -- no direct execution.
4. Keep tool implementations stateless; shared state lives in `ToolContext`.

## Adding a New Dashboard Component

1. Create `src/dashboard/frontend/src/components/MyComponent.svelte`.
2. Import and render it from `App.svelte` (add a tab if it's a top-level view).
3. Add any new API response types to `lib/types.ts`.
4. If you need new backend endpoints, add handlers in `src/dashboard/handlers.rs` and register routes in `src/dashboard/routes.rs`.
5. Rebuild: `pnpm run build:ui && cargo build`.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all Rust tests
cargo test

# Run with a specific test
cargo test test_name

# Lint
cargo clippy
cargo fmt -- --check
```

There is no formal frontend test suite yet. Manual testing against the running dashboard is the current workflow.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before opening a PR, verify:

- [ ] `cargo fmt` produces no changes
- [ ] `cargo clippy` produces no warnings
- [ ] `cargo build` succeeds (default features)
- [ ] `cargo build --features local` succeeds (if LLM backend code was changed)
- [ ] `pnpm run build:ui` succeeds (if frontend was changed)
- [ ] Commit messages follow the format described above
- [ ] PR targets `develop`, not `main`
- [ ] New tools/endpoints are documented in `AGENTS.md`

## AI-Generated Contributions

We welcome contributions that involve AI assistance, but transparency is required.

If any part of your contribution was generated or substantially authored by an AI model (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, a local model, etc.), you **must**:

1. **Attest to the model used.** Include a line in your commit message body or PR description identifying the AI system. For example:

   ```
   Co-authored-by: Claude 4 Opus (Anthropic)
   ```

   ```
   Co-authored-by: GPT-4o (OpenAI)
   ```

   ```
   Co-authored-by: Qwen 3 235B (Alibaba Cloud)
   ```

2. **Credit the AI as a co-author.** Use the `Co-authored-by` git trailer (as shown above) in every commit that contains AI-generated code. This is not optional -- it is a condition of contribution.

3. **You are responsible for correctness.** AI co-authorship does not reduce your obligation to review, test, and understand the code you submit. The human contributor remains accountable for the contribution's quality, security implications, and adherence to this project's style and standards.

4. **Disclose the scope.** If only a portion of a commit was AI-generated (e.g., boilerplate, tests, documentation), note that in the commit body. If the entire implementation was AI-driven, say so.

**Why we require this:** SafeClaw is itself an AI agent project. We believe in honest attribution. Knowing which code was human-written vs. AI-assisted helps reviewers calibrate their review, helps maintainers understand the provenance of the codebase, and sets an industry norm for transparency.

Contributions that omit required AI attribution may be rejected or asked to amend their commit history.
