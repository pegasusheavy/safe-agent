# safe-agent — Roadmap

> What it takes to go from "cool project" to "indispensable agentic companion."

---

## 0. Critical Foundation — Structured Tool Calling ✅

~~The single biggest gap.~~ **Implemented.** The LLM now proposes tool calls
via `` ```tool_call `` fenced blocks in its response. The agent parses them,
routes through auto-approve or the approval queue, executes, feeds results
back, and loops up to `max_tool_turns` (default 5).

- [x] **Implement structured tool-call parsing from LLM output**
      `src/agent/tool_parse.rs` parses JSON tool invocations from LLM
      responses. `src/llm/prompts.rs` injects tool schemas and calling
      protocol into the system prompt for all 6 backends.
- [x] **Multi-turn tool chaining** — `handle_message` loops: call LLM →
      parse → execute auto-approved tools → feed results back → repeat
      until the LLM returns a final text reply or `max_tool_turns` hit.
- [x] **Auto-approve safe tools** — `auto_approve_tools` from config is
      checked for every tool call. Matching tools execute immediately;
      others go to the approval queue.
- [x] **Streaming tool progress** — structured SSE events (`thinking`,
      `tool_start`, `tool_result`, `approval_needed`, `turn_complete`,
      `error`) pushed to the dashboard live feed and messaging platforms.
      Dashboard shows a real-time "Tool Activity" panel on Overview with
      animated indicators. Chat tab shows contextual thinking/executing
      state. Typing indicators sent to Telegram/WhatsApp during tool
      execution. REST `/api/tool-events` endpoint for page-reload hydration.

---

## 1. Autonomy & Planning ✅

- [x] **Background goals** — goals and tasks are stored in the DB (`goals`
      + `goal_tasks` tables). The agent works on one task per tick, picking
      the highest-priority active goal's next actionable task. Tasks can
      have tool calls or free-form LLM objectives.
- [x] **Task decomposition** — the `goal` tool lets the LLM create goals,
      break them into subtasks with dependency chains, and track progress.
      Tasks execute in dependency order.
- [x] **Cron-driven autonomy** — the cron scheduler is now wired into the
      tick loop. Enabled cron jobs are checked every tick; due jobs are
      executed via `ToolRegistry`. Cron tool enabled by default.
- [x] **Self-reflection loop** — when a goal completes or fails, the LLM
      generates a self-reflection (stored on the goal), evaluating what
      went well and what to improve.
- [x] **Proactive notifications** — background goal progress and cron job
      results are pushed to all messaging platforms (Telegram/WhatsApp)
      automatically. Goal completions include the reflection.
- [x] **Goal persistence** — goals and tasks stored in SQLite, survive
      restarts. Dashboard "Goals" tab shows all goals with status filters,
      task progress bars, self-reflections, and pause/resume/cancel controls.

---

## 2. Memory & Learning

The memory system is fully functional: archival memory with FTS5 search
plus optional vector embeddings (via Ollama) for semantic RAG, windowed
conversation history with per-user isolation, knowledge graph with
traversal and auto-population, episodic memory recording what happened
in each interaction, structured user profiles, automatic post-conversation
extraction of facts/preferences/entities, and periodic consolidation of
old memories. Core memory persists across sessions.

- [x] **Embedding-based retrieval (RAG)** — Ollama embedding API
      (`nomic-embed-text` default) generates vectors stored as BLOBs in
      SQLite with brute-force cosine similarity search.  Falls back to
      FTS5 when Ollama is unavailable.  Configured via `[memory]` config.
- [x] **Automatic memory extraction** — post-conversation LLM pipeline
      (`memory/extraction.rs`) extracts facts, user preferences, entities,
      and relations, storing them across archival memory, user profiles,
      and the knowledge graph.  Enabled by `memory.auto_extract` (default
      true).
- [x] **Episodic memory** — `episodes` table records trigger, summary,
      tool actions (JSON), outcome, and user ID per interaction.  Queried
      by recency or keyword.
- [x] **User model** — `user_profiles` table with UPSERT key-value
      entries per user (preferences, communication style, interests, etc.)
      Auto-populated by the extraction pipeline and injected into the LLM
      context as `== USER PROFILE ==`.
- [x] **Knowledge graph auto-population** — the extraction pipeline
      identifies entities and relations from conversations and inserts
      them as knowledge graph nodes/edges automatically.
- [x] **Memory decay & consolidation** — `consolidation.rs` runs every
      tick, finds archival memories older than `consolidation_age_days`
      (default 30), groups a batch, asks the LLM to summarize, replaces
      originals with a consolidated entry.  `consolidated` flag prevents
      re-processing.
- [x] **Cross-session context** — conversation history persists in SQLite
      across sessions; archival search lets the agent find past info.

---

## 3. Perception & Multimodal

- [ ] **Vision (image tool)** — wire the placeholder image tool to a
      vision model (Claude vision, GPT-4o, local). Accept images from
      Telegram/WhatsApp and the dashboard.
- [ ] **Document understanding** — ingest PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets.
      Extract text, tables, and structure.
- [ ] **Voice input** — accept voice messages from Telegram/WhatsApp,
      transcribe with Whisper (local or API), pass text to the LLM.
- [ ] **Voice output** — TTS for responses. Let the user choose between
      text and voice replies per-platform.
- [ ] **Screen/clipboard awareness** — optional desktop companion mode
      where the agent can see what the user is looking at.

---

## 4. Browser Automation

The browser tool uses `chromiumoxide` for full CDP control of a headless
Chrome/Chromium instance.  All actions are exposed as parameters of the
single `browser` tool (action dispatch pattern).

- [x] **CDP integration** — launch a headless browser, navigate pages,
      extract content, take screenshots, evaluate arbitrary JavaScript.
- [x] **Authenticated browsing** — `auth_navigate` action loads OAuth
      tokens from the `oauth_tokens` table and monkey-patches `fetch()`
      and `XMLHttpRequest` to inject `Authorization: Bearer` headers on
      every request.  The LLM specifies `provider` and `account`.
- [x] **Screenshot & visual grounding** — `screenshot_describe` takes a
      full-page screenshot AND runs `ELEMENT_MAP_SCRIPT` JS to enumerate
      every interactive element (`<a>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, etc.) with
      index, tag, text, and bounding-box coordinates.  The LLM can then
      call `click_element` by CSS selector or element index.
- [x] **Web scraping toolkit** — `scrape` action takes a CSS selector
      and optional list of HTML attributes to extract.  Returns structured
      JSON with tag, text content, and requested attributes per element.
- [x] **Bookmark & read-later** — `bookmark` action saves the current
      page (URL, title, meta-description excerpt) as a `bookmark` node in
      the knowledge graph and also stores a copy in archival memory.
      Supports optional tags which become `tag` nodes with `tagged` edges.

---

## 5. Communication & Messaging

- [ ] **Email sending** — use OAuth tokens to send email (Gmail API,
      Microsoft Graph). Currently read-only.
- [ ] **Email monitoring** — watch inbox for important messages, summarize,
      and notify. Draft replies for approval.
- [ ] **SMS/iMessage bridge** — for users who don't use Telegram.
- [ ] **Matrix/Signal support** — privacy-focused messaging alternatives.
- [ ] **Slack workspace bot** — not just OAuth tokens, but an actual
      Slack bot presence the agent can operate.
- [ ] **Discord bot** — same as Slack; presence in Discord servers.
- [ ] **Rich messaging** — send images, files, formatted cards, and
      inline buttons (Telegram supports all of these).
- [ ] **Group chat awareness** — understand multi-user conversations,
      only respond when addressed or relevant.

---

## 6. Integrations & Actions

- [ ] **Calendar write access** — create, update, delete events. Currently
      read-only. Propose changes through the approval queue.
- [ ] **Smart home** — Home Assistant / HomeKit integration. "Turn off
      the lights," "set thermostat to 72."
- [ ] **Music control** — Spotify playback control via existing OAuth.
- [ ] **Git operations** — clone repos, create branches, make commits,
      open PRs using the GitHub OAuth token.
- [ ] **Note-taking** — Notion/Obsidian integration for structured notes.
- [ ] **File sync** — Dropbox/Drive upload and download for sharing files.
- [ ] **Finance tracking** — Plaid or bank API integration for expense
      monitoring and budgeting.
- [ ] **Location awareness** — "What's the weather?" "Find a restaurant
      nearby." Requires opt-in location sharing.
- [ ] **Webhooks & IFTTT** — expose an incoming webhook so external
      services can trigger the agent.

---

## 7. Security & Trust

- [x] **Capability-based permissions** — `SecurityConfig` with `blocked_tools`,
      `tool_capabilities` (per-tool operation allowlists), and `CapabilityChecker`
      that infers operations from tool params (e.g. exec command name, file read/write).
      Enforced in `handle_message` before every tool execution.
- [x] **Audit trail dashboard** — `audit_log` DB table with structured events
      (tool_call, approval, rate_limit, pii_detected, 2fa, permission_denied).
      `AuditLogger` with convenience methods. Dashboard Security tab with filterable
      audit log, summary stats, and per-event "Why?" explainability drill-down.
      API: `/api/security/audit`, `/api/security/audit/summary`, `/api/security/audit/{id}/explain`.
- [x] **Cost tracking** — `llm_usage` DB table tracking backend, model, token counts,
      and estimated USD cost per request. `CostTracker` with model-aware pricing
      (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek, etc.). Daily cost limit with alerts.
      Dashboard shows today/month/all-time costs, token counts, and budget progress bar.
      API: `/api/security/cost`, `/api/security/cost/recent`.
- [x] **Rate limiting** — sliding-window `RateLimiter` (in-memory) with configurable
      per-minute and per-hour caps (default: 30/min, 300/hr). Returns `RateLimited`
      error. Checked before every tool execution in `handle_message`. Dashboard
      shows live usage bars. API: `/api/security/rate-limit`.
- [x] **Sensitive data detection** — `PiiScanner` detects SSNs, credit cards,
      API keys (sk-*, AKIA*), private keys, JWT tokens, passwords, and AWS keys.
      Scans LLM responses before sending; prepends a warning if PII found.
      Events logged to audit trail. Configurable via `pii_detection = true/false`.
- [x] **Explainability** — every tool call, approval, and security event is
      logged with reasoning, params, user context, and source. The `explain_action`
      method retrieves the causal chain (up to 10 related events within 1 minute)
      for any audit entry. Dashboard "Why?" button on each audit row opens a
      step-by-step reasoning modal.
- [x] **Multi-user support** — `users` DB table with UUID IDs, roles
      (admin/user/viewer), platform identity mapping (Telegram ID, WhatsApp
      JID, email). `UserManager` with full CRUD, authentication, and lookup
      by platform ID. `UserContext` threaded through `handle_message_as()`
      for per-user permission enforcement (viewers blocked from chat, only
      admins can approve). Per-user conversation memory isolation via
      `user_id` column on `conversation_history` (also added to
      `activity_log`, `audit_log`, `goals`, `pending_actions`).
      Dashboard login supports username+password (multi-user) alongside
      legacy single-password mode. JWT claims extended with `user_id` and
      `role`. SSO callback links email to existing users. Telegram and
      WhatsApp handlers look up users by platform ID before routing to
      agent. Dashboard shows current user identity in header, Settings tab
      includes full user management panel (create, edit roles, enable/
      disable, link platform IDs, delete). API: `/api/users` (CRUD).
- [x] **Dashboard 2FA & passkeys** — TOTP (RFC 6238) two-factor
      authentication with authenticator app QR code setup, 10 single-use
      recovery codes, and enable/disable flow requiring code verification.
      WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey support via `webauthn-rs` for biometric and
      security-key 2FA. Challenge-token login flow: password auth returns
      a short-lived JWT; user must verify via TOTP, recovery code, or
      passkey assertion to receive the full session. DB: `totp_secret`,
      `totp_enabled`, `recovery_codes` columns on `users`; `passkeys`
      table. API: `/api/auth/2fa/{setup,enable,disable,status,verify}`,
      `/api/auth/passkey/{register,authenticate}/{start,finish}`,
      `/api/auth/passkeys` (list/delete). Dashboard Settings tab adds a
      Two-Factor Authentication panel; login overlay shows 2FA challenge
      step with passkey button, TOTP input, and recovery code fallback.
- [x] **PII encryption at rest** — auto-generates a 256-bit AES key on
      first launch (`<data_dir>/encryption.key`, 0600 perms). All PII
      fields in the `users` table are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before
      storage: `display_name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `telegram_id`,
      `whatsapp_id`, `totp_secret`, `recovery_codes`. Encrypted values
      use `ENC$<base64(nonce‖ciphertext)>` format; legacy plaintext is
      auto-migrated on startup via `migrate_encrypt_pii()`. Lookup fields
      (`email`, `telegram_id`, `whatsapp_id`) use HMAC-SHA-256 blind
      indexes in separate `*_blind` columns so SQL equality queries work
      without exposing plaintext. Key derivation separates the HMAC blind
      key from the AES key. Module: `src/crypto.rs` (`FieldEncryptor`).
- [x] **2FA for dangerous ops** — `TwoFactorManager` with configurable
      `require_2fa` tool list (default: `["exec"]`). Creates time-limited
      challenges (5 min TTL) that must be confirmed via dashboard before
      execution proceeds. Dashboard 2FA tab shows pending challenges with
      Confirm/Reject buttons. API: `/api/security/2fa`, `/api/security/2fa/{id}/confirm`,
      `/api/security/2fa/{id}/reject`.

---

## 8. Dashboard & UX

- [x] **Mobile-responsive design** — hamburger menu for mobile navigation,
      scrollable tab bar, responsive grid layouts, touch-friendly header
      controls with proper breakpoints (sm/md/lg).
- [x] **Real-time activity feed** — `LiveFeed` component wired to SSE
      `ToolEvent` stream, showing thinking, tool execution, approvals, and
      completions in real time with colored indicators and timestamps.
- [x] **Conversation history browser** — `ConversationHistory` component
      in Settings with full-text search, role filtering (user/assistant/system),
      pagination, and message timestamps. Backend endpoint
      `GET /api/memory/conversation/history` with search and offset support.
- [x] **Approval notifications** — Browser Notification API integration:
      notification bell toggle in header, permission request flow, automatic
      push notifications when `approval_needed` SSE events arrive while the
      dashboard is not focused. Clicking a notification focuses the window
      and navigates to the overview tab.
- [x] **Skill marketplace UI** — `SkillMarketplace` component in the Skills
      tab showing featured community skills with categories (Productivity,
      Development, Communication, Data), search, filtering, and one-click
      install via the existing `/api/skills/import` endpoint. Links to
      GitHub topic browse for discovering more skills.
- [x] **Visual knowledge graph** — `KnowledgeGraphViz` canvas component
      with a force-directed layout simulation (repulsion, attraction, centering).
      Nodes colored by type, draggable, zoomable, pannable. List/Graph toggle
      in the Knowledge tab header. Edge loading via neighbor API batches.
      Selected node detail panel with edge list. Type legend.
- [x] **Agent persona editor** — `PersonaEditor` component in Settings tab
      allowing direct editing of the core personality text with save/unsaved
      indicators. Backend `GET/PUT /api/persona` endpoints.
- [x] **Dark/light theme toggle** — Light theme CSS variable overrides via
      `[data-theme="light"]` selector. Toggle button (sun/moon icon) in
      header. Persisted in localStorage. Applies to all surfaces, borders,
      text colors, and shadows.
- [x] **OAuth account management UX** — Token health indicators (green
      check for healthy, yellow exclamation for expiring soon < 24h, red X
      for expired). Expiry timestamps displayed. Re-authorize button for
      expired tokens linking directly to the OAuth flow. Scope display.
- [x] **PWA support** — Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`) with app icons
      (192px and 512px), standalone display, theme colors. Service worker
      (`sw.js`) with precaching of app shell and stale-while-revalidate for
      assets. Install banner with dismiss/persist. `<meta>` tags for
      theme-color, apple-mobile-web-app-capable.

---

## 9. Multi-Agent & Sessions

- [ ] **Session system activation** — the sessions table and tools exist
      but are disabled by default. Enable and test multi-agent workflows.
- [ ] **Agent-to-agent delegation** — spawn sub-agents for parallel
      research, code review, or data processing.
- [ ] **Specialist personas** — different personality/prompt profiles
      for different tasks (coding, writing, research, personal assistant).
- [ ] **Collaborative planning** — agents discuss and refine a plan
      before executing.

---

## 10. Skill Ecosystem

- [ ] **Skill versioning** — track versions in skill.toml; support
      rollback.
- [ ] **Skill dependency management** — skills can declare dependencies
      on other skills.
- [ ] **Community skill registry** — a central catalog of shareable
      skills with install-from-URL.
- [x] **TypeScript/Node.js skills** — Node.js skill entrypoints (`.js`,
      `.mjs`, `.cjs`) with automatic `npm install` / `pnpm install` when a
      `package.json` is present.
- [x] **Rhai embedded skills** — `.rhai` entrypoints run in-process via
      `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` with a sandboxed API surface (HTTP,
      file I/O, env vars, Telegram, JSON, logging). Zero-overhead for
      lightweight automation.
- [x] **Python virtual environments** — `venv` field in `skill.toml`
      (`"auto"` | `"always"` | `"never"`). When enabled, the skill manager
      creates a `.venv/`, upgrades pip, installs `requirements.txt`, and
      runs the skill with the venv Python. `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` set by default.
- [x] **Skill lifecycle API** — `POST /api/skills/{name}/stop`,
      `/api/skills/{name}/start`, `/api/skills/{name}/restart`. Manually
      stopped skills are tracked and excluded from auto-reconciliation
      until explicitly restarted.
- [ ] **Skill sandboxing** — per-skill filesystem and network isolation
      (currently all skills share the same sandbox).
- [ ] **Skill health monitoring** — dashboard widget showing uptime,
      restart count, memory usage, and error rate per skill.
- [ ] **Hot reload** — detect skill file changes and restart without
      a full agent restart.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

- [x] **ARM64 Docker builds** — CI builds `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` via
      `docker/build-push-action` with Buildx. Dockerfile handles arch-aware
      ngrok download (`uname -m` → `amd64`/`arm64`). Supports Raspberry Pi,
      Apple Silicon servers, and AWS Graviton.
- [x] **Auto-update mechanism** — `/api/update/check` queries GitHub Releases
      API and compares semver. `/api/update/apply` runs `git pull --ff-only`
      + `cargo build --release` (or signals container restart for Docker).
      Dashboard Ops tab shows current/latest version, release notes, and
      one-click update button.
- [x] **Backup & restore** — `/api/backup` exports all agent data
      (core_memory, archival_memory, activity_log, cron_jobs, goals,
      goal_tasks, agent_stats) as a timestamped JSON file. `/api/restore`
      accepts the JSON and merges via INSERT OR REPLACE. Dashboard Ops tab
      has download and upload buttons.
- [x] **Health check endpoint** — `/healthz` (unauthenticated) returns
      200 OK with component health (database, agent, tools count, version)
      or 503 if unhealthy. Suitable for load balancers, Docker HEALTHCHECK,
      and Kubernetes liveness probes.
- [x] **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` (unauthenticated) exposes
      counters and gauges in OpenMetrics text format: agent info, paused
      state, tool count, tick/approve/reject totals, audit events, LLM
      cost/tokens, rate limiter state. Ready for Grafana/Prometheus scraping.
- [x] **Multi-node federation** — `FederationManager` with peer registry,
      heartbeat protocol, memory delta replication, and distributed task
      claiming. `[federation]` config section with `enabled`, `peers`,
      `advertise_address`, intervals. API: `/api/federation/status`,
      `/api/federation/peers`, `/api/federation/sync` (peer-to-peer),
      `/api/federation/heartbeat`, `/api/federation/claim`. Dashboard Ops
      tab shows node info, peer list, add/remove peers.
- [x] **Plugin architecture for LLM backends** — `LlmBackend` async trait
      with `name()` and `generate()`. `LlmPluginRegistry` for dynamic
      registration. All built-in backends (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Aider,
      OpenRouter, Local) implement the trait and auto-register. `LlmEngine`
      wraps the active backend + registry; supports `register_plugin()` and
      `switch_backend()` at runtime. API: `/api/llm/backends`.

---

## 12. Polish & Quality of Life

- [x] **Onboarding wizard** — first-run setup flow in the dashboard
      (set name, connect messaging, configure OAuth, test LLM).
      Full-screen 4-step wizard appears on first launch: (1) Welcome /
      Agent Identity — set `agent_name` and `core_personality`, (2) LLM
      Backend — pick from available backends with a "Test Connection"
      button that sends a test prompt, (3) Messaging — shows Telegram &
      WhatsApp status (skippable), (4) Review / Finish — summary with
      "Complete Setup" button. State is tracked in a new `metadata`
      key-value table; subsequent launches skip the wizard. Config
      changes are written to the TOML config file on disk. All
      onboarding endpoints are exempt from auth middleware so the wizard
      works before any user account exists.
- [ ] **Natural language config** — "Scruffy, start checking my email
      every hour" should create a cron + skill automatically.
- [ ] **Undo for everything** — not just file deletions (trash), but
      message edits, config changes, skill modifications.
- [ ] **Contextual help** — "What can you do?" returns a dynamic list
      based on what's configured and connected.
- [ ] **Conversation branching** — fork a conversation to explore
      different approaches without losing the original thread.
- [ ] **Notification preferences** — per-topic and per-severity
      notification routing (urgent → Telegram, FYI → dashboard only).
- [x] **Timezone & locale awareness** — respect the user's timezone for
      all date/time operations and responses. System-level default timezone
      and locale configurable via `config.toml` (`timezone = "America/New_York"`,
      `locale = "en-US"`).  Per-user overrides stored in the `users` table.
      The LLM system prompt includes the current local date/time so the agent
      gives time-aware responses (greetings, scheduling, etc.).  Dashboard
      Settings has a Timezone & Locale panel with browser auto-detection and
      a searchable IANA timezone picker.  All user-facing timestamps in the
      dashboard (activity log, audit trail, chat, knowledge graph, goals,
      memory panels) are formatted in the user's local timezone via a shared
      `time.ts` utility that parses both RFC 3339 and SQLite datetime formats.
      Backend API: `GET/POST /api/timezone`, `GET /api/timezones` (full list),
      `GET /api/timezone/convert` (server-side conversion).  Crate: `chrono-tz`.
- [ ] **i18n** — multi-language support for the dashboard and agent
      responses.

## 13. Website & Documentation

- [x] **GitHub Pages landing site** — Svelte 5 + SvelteKit static site
      in `web/` with Tailwind CSS 4 and FontAwesome 6. Sections: hero
      with `docker pull` command, features grid, 3-step quick start guide,
      architecture overview, skill system showcase, and get-involved links.
      Dark theme (slate-950/emerald accent). Docker-first messaging
      throughout. Deployed via `actions/deploy-pages@v4` on push to
      `develop` or `main`.
- [x] **GHCR container images** — GitHub Actions workflow builds and
      pushes multi-arch Docker images (amd64 + arm64) to
      `ghcr.io/pegasusheavy/safe-agent` on version tags (`v*`).
- [x] **Comprehensive Docker README** — full Quick Start section covering
      directory setup, `.env` configuration, `docker run` command with
      mount explanations, Docker Compose example, optional mounts (Claude
      CLI, ngrok, ACME), build-from-source, UID/GID matching, and ARM64.
- [x] **AI co-authorship policy** — `CONTRIBUTING.md` requires attestation
      of the AI model used and `Co-authored-by` git trailer for all
      AI-assisted contributions.
- [ ] **API reference** — auto-generated docs for all REST endpoints.
- [ ] **Skill authoring guide** — tutorial for writing Python, Node.js,
      Rhai, and shell skills with `skill.toml` examples.

*This list is ordered roughly by impact. Item 0 (structured tool calling)
has been implemented and unlocks almost everything else.*
